# Client Data Generation for Transaction Management

## Overview

This process generates and inserts synthetic client data into the `clients` table in the PostgreSQL database using the `Faker` library.

## Steps

1. **Generate Client Data**:
   - For each client, a random name and email are generated using `Faker`.

2. **Bulk Insert**:
   - Rather than inserting each client one by one, multiple clients are inserted at once using `executemany()`. This minimizes database round trips and enhances performance.

3. **Commit Changes**:
   - After the data is inserted, changes are committed to the database to ensure persistence.

## Benefits

- **Improved Performance**: Bulk insert reduces the number of database operations, making it more efficient for large datasets.
- **Simplified Logic**: The process is optimized and easier to maintain compared to individual inserts.

## Future Considerations

- Handle large datasets efficiently by batching inserts if required.
